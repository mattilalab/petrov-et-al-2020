1) Add statistical analyses to AutoCoEv results.
2) Add better post-processing of the results:
   - MSA column colouring
   - Trimmed trees with species names, instead of taxid
3) At the moment, we offer a virtual machine image with Slackware 14.2
   and all necessary software preinstalled, upon request.
   We are planning to create Docker or Singularity containers for
   AutoCoEv, as well.
4) Make downloading OrthoDB flexible for the database version. At the
   moment, the script downloads 10v1
